# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.

##
build
The current runner (ubuntu-24.04-x64) was detected as self-hosted because the platform does not match a GitHub-hosted runner image (or that image is deprecated and no longer supported).
In such a case, you should install Ruby in the $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE yourself, for example using https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build
You can take inspiration from this workflow for more details: https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml
$ ruby-build 3.1.4 /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64
Once that completes successfully, mark it as complete with:
$ touch /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64.complete
It is your responsibility to ensure installing Ruby like that is not done in parallel.
